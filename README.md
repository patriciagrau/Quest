THE VALLEY OF MYSTERY

"Hello young adventurer! It seems you have fallen into a cave, whilst you were coming back from school near the Valley of Mystery. There are many legends of this place, of the treasures it contains, but also of the dangers within. Letâ€™s try to get out of here! "

In this game, you are a child who has fallen into a cave, and need to get out. There are monsters and treasures on the way, as well as allies and objects that help you win. There are 12 possible endings, four in which you win, and eight in which you die. 

Good luck, adventurer!
